    </header>
    <p> <b> Blockchain technology </b> is most simply defined as a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the
        provenance
        of a digital asset. By inherent design, the data on a blockchain is unable to be modified, which makes it a
        legitimate disruptor for industries like payments, cybersecurity and healthcare. This blog will help you to
        understand
        what is bsslockchain technology, how it's used and its history.</p>

    <h3>What is blockchain technology?</h3>
    <p>A <b> blockchain </b> is a database that stores encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a
        chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary
        technology because it helps reduce risk, stamps out fraud and brings transparency in a scalable way for myriad
        uses. Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital
        asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.</p>
    <p>A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it
        with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a
        decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is locked
        out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time,
        making changes completely transparent.</p>

    <h3>How Does Blockchain Work?</h3>
    Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.
    <p>
    <h4>Blocks</h4> Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements: data, nonce and
    hash. When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the block is
    considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.</p>
    <p>
    <h4>Miners</h4> Miners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining. Miners use special software
    to solve the incredibly complex math problem of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. When a block is
    successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>Nodes</h4>A computer is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of
    electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning.Every node has its own
    copy of the blockchain and the network must algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be
    updated, trusted and verified.
